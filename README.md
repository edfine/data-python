Tools and techniques in python to get better at data analytics

Intended as a 4 day class

Take your analytics to the next level by building on your existing knowledge of Python.  We will advance your facility with data by learning to leverage the Python data tools. Increase data manipulation, preparation  and visualization skills. 
The Data Focused Python class is designed for analysts and developers who can write scripts in Python and have some experience with data manipulation in programs like Tableau or using SQL queries.  
This fast paced course begins with a quick review of Python datatypes, scripts and libraries. It moves to Python software packages, tools and techniques used in data transformation, manipulating, visualizing and presenting data.  We will focus on some key packages including Numpy, Pandas and Seaborn and how they lever techniques like objects, decorators and typing in Python. With an opinionated view on effectively creating and sharing insights from data, we will expand to modern options for serving, sharing, packaging and deployment. 

Course Objectives: 
* Import and explore data in numerous formats including files, SQL and NoSQL databases
* Understand and work with some of Pythonâ€™s more advanced features including the object model, the Python data model, decorators and type hints at a level that makes is possible to use almost any Python package and read the source code 
* Use visualization packages and descriptive statistics to get an understanding of new data sets
* Manipulate data to organize it for analysis
* Develop and share persuasive code, interactive visualizations and analysis with Jupyter notebooks 
* Create an API to serve data.
